    35 years earlier. He points out the stances assumed by the
    authorities responsible allowed for an explosion of an inflationary

- annote: This is just one example of the view held by MMTers that
    transfer payments are inflationary. However, you'll find that they
    don't think that public jobs would have the same effect, despite no
    evidence to their point, as even Matt Breunig has pointed out
    multiple times.

- abstract: "This article describes three long-run monetary facts
    derived by examining data for 110 countries over a 30-year period,
    using three definitions of a country's money supply and two
    subsamples of countries: (1) Growth rates of the money supply and
    the general price level are highly correlated for all three money
    definitions, for the full sample of countries, and for both
    subsamples. (2) The growth rates of money and real output are not
    correlated, except for a subsample of countries in the Organisation
    for Economic Co-operation and Development, where these growth rates
    are positively correlated. (3) The rate of inflation and the growth
    rate of real output are essentially uncorrelated. ; Reprinted in

- abstract: This paper constructs a simple model for analyzing
    short-term economic fluctuations that bypasses the problem of the
    division of a change in nominal income between prices and output.
    The model combines one element from Irving Fisher (the difference
    between the nominal and the real interest rate) and one element from
    John Maynard Keynes (the determination of market interest rates by
    speculators with firmly held anticipations) with two empirical
    assumptions (a unit real income elasticity of demand for money and
    an exogenous excess of the real interest rate over the real secular
    rate of growth). The result is a model connecting current nominal
    income with current and prior nominal quantities of money.

- abstract: Can cash aid harm non-recipients by raising local prices? We
    show that a householdtargeted cash transfer in the Philippines
    increases the prices of perishable foods in some markets and raises
    stunting among non-beneficiary children by 11 percentage points (34
    percent). Impacts increase in the size of the village income shock
    and remoteness-- and are sustained 2.5 years after program
    introduction. Price effects from an experimental sample are
    confirmed with national expenditure surveys collected during program
    scaleup. Household-targeted cash transfers can thus generate local
    spillovers that undermine program goals. Selected geographic
    targeting may avoid price spillovers at moderate additional cost.

- abstract: Universal basic income (UBI) is an increasingly popular
    policy proposal but there is no evidence regarding its longer-term
    consequences. We study UBI in a general equilibrium model with
    imperfect capital markets, labor market shocks, and
    intergenerational linkages via skill formation and transfers. We
    find that UBI increases-welfare for older agents but has
    large-welfare losses for younger agents and future generations. A
    sizable share of the negative effects stem from the endogenous
    intergenerational linkages. Modeling automation as an increased
    probability of an "out-of-work" shock, the model provides insights
    on the changing welfare consequence of UBI in a riskier environment.
