(2) The growth rates of money and real output are not correlated, except for a subsample of countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, where these growth rates are positively correlated. (3) The rate of inflation and the growth rate of real output are essentially uncorrelated. ; Reprinted in Quarterly Review, Fall 2001 (v. 25, no. 4)},

 abstract = {This paper constructs a simple model for analyzing short-term economic fluctuations that bypasses the problem of the division of a change in nominal income between prices and output. The model combines one element from Irving Fisher (the difference between the nominal and the real interest rate) and one element from John Maynard Keynes (the determination of market interest rates by speculators with firmly held anticipations) with two empirical assumptions (a unit real income elasticity of demand for money and an exogenous excess of the real interest rate over the real secular rate of growth). The result is a model connecting current nominal income with current and prior nominal quantities of money.},

Impacts increase in the size of the village income shock and remoteness-- and are sustained 2.5 years after program introduction. Price effects from an experimental sample are confirmed with national expenditure surveys collected during program scaleup. Household-targeted cash transfers can thus generate local spillovers that undermine program goals. Selected geographic targeting may avoid price spillovers at moderate additional cost.}",

 abstract = {Universal basic income (UBI) is an increasingly popular policy proposal but there is no evidence regarding its longer-term consequences. We study UBI in a general equilibrium model with imperfect capital markets, labor market shocks, and intergenerational linkages via skill formation and transfers. We find that UBI increases-welfare for older agents but has large-welfare losses for younger agents and future generations. A sizable share of the negative effects stem from the endogenous intergenerational linkages. Modeling automation as an increased probability of an “out-of-work” shock, the model provides insights on the changing welfare consequence of UBI in a riskier environment.},
